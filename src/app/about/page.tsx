            Early Career and Breakthrough
          </h2>
          <p>
            Stephen King's writing journey began in earnest during his years at
            the University of Maine at Orono. While struggling to make ends
            meet, King worked a series of labor jobs, writing short stories
            during his free time. His early works were published in men's
            magazines, and it wasn't until 1973 that his breakthrough came with
            the acceptance of Carrie for publication by Doubleday & Co.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carrie was an instant success, and the novel's publication allowed
            King to leave his job as a high school English teacher and write
            full-time. Little did he know, this was just the beginning. The
            success of Carrie led to a string of bestsellers, including The
            Shining, It, The Stand, and Pet Sematary. His career skyrocketed,
            and King quickly became one of the most prolific and influential
            authors of modern horror fiction.

            Themes and Inspiration Behind His Books
          </h2>
          <p>
            One of the defining characteristics of Stephen King's writing is his
            exploration of fear—both the supernatural and the very real. King's
            stories often depict ordinary people in extraordinary situations,
            facing the unknown, whether it's an evil entity like Pennywise from
            It or the terrifying isolation in The Shining. However, beyond just
            horror, King’s novels delve deeply into the human experience—fear,
            hope, redemption, and survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            King draws inspiration from his own life, as well as from the world
            around him. His childhood experiences in small towns in Maine
            heavily influence the settings of his books, creating a distinctive
            atmosphere where the ordinary meets the terrifying. The themes of
            community, isolation, and the clash between good and evil are
            central to much of his work.
          </p>
          <p>
            King's deep understanding of the human condition is one of the
            reasons his work resonates with readers worldwide. He often taps
            into real-life fears and anxieties, magnifying them through his
            vivid imagination. Whether it's the claustrophobic terror of being
            trapped in a small town (Salem’s Lot), or the psychological horror
            of a mother-and-son relationship (Gerald's Game), King's ability to
            mix relatable, real-world concerns with supernatural elements makes
            his writing universally captivating.

            Writing Style and Impact on Literature
          </h2>
          <p>
            Stephen King is known for his unique writing style that combines a
            masterful command of language with a deep understanding of his
            characters. His writing is often described as direct, unpretentious,
            and character-driven. King has the ability to create vivid,
            unforgettable characters—often ordinary people thrown into
            extraordinary circumstances. His use of everyday dialogue, along
            with his descriptions of emotions and fears, makes his characters
            incredibly relatable.
          </p>
          <p>
            King’s impact on literature is immeasurable. Not only has he written
            more than 60 novels, but his works have been adapted into numerous
            films, television shows, and stage plays. He has inspired
            generations of writers in the horror, suspense, and thriller genres,
            but his influence extends beyond genre fiction. Many of King’s books
            address societal issues, such as addiction, mental illness, and the
            darkness of the human psyche, making them much more than simple
            horror stories.
